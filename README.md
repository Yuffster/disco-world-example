Introduction
==============

This library includes example room and description files created during the
initial prototyping of the Disco mudlib during the first Node Knockout
competition.

Usage Instructions
==============

These files will not run on their own.  They must be loaded using the server.js
script within the disco-engine repository.  You should be able to find the
disco-engine repository in the same place you found this one.

If not, please see <http://github.com/Yuffster> or contact Michelle Steigerwalt
through <http://msteigerwalt.com> for more information.
